Priority given to 2023-2025 publications or to earlier case files that remain active.",
    "validationPhase": "Cross-referenced each high-impact data point with at least one government source (CIAA/OAG/MoHP/MoE/NPC) and one reputable NGO/media source where possible. Flagged confidence levels (high/medium/low) and documented source URLs in the dataset.",
    "structuringPhase": "Converted verified figures into the JSON structure requested. Monetary values normalized to NPR and population/household impacts expressed in per-day or per-month units where requested.",
    "reviewPhase": "All included URLs were checked on 2025-09-18 during data assembly. Where a number is an estimate or derived, the derivation and confidence flag are included.",
    "outputPhase": "This JSON is pretty-printed, dates in YYYY-MM-DD, no comments in JSON, victim names anonymized."

  "notesAndLimitations": {
    "1": "Some human-impact attributions (e.g., daily deaths explicitly 'caused by corruption') are inferential; exact causation cannot be determined from public sources alone. Values provided for such items are conservative estimates with confidence flags.",
    "2": "All monetary aggregations (e.g., daily leakage estimate) are constructed from audit findings and known large-contract values; these should be re-calculated when new OAG/CIAA annual statements are published.",
    "3": "Testimonial identities have been anonymized to protect victims; full records exist in media / NGO repositories and are referenced in 'sources' where possible.",
    "4": "This dataset focuses on 2023–2025 primary sources where available; older cases are included only when they remain material to systemic patterns (e.g., TSC 2017 case)."
  },
  "updateGuidelines": {
    "dailyToll": "Recalculate monthly using OAG/CIAA monthly summaries and sectoral ministry updates (MoHP, MoE).",
    "caseStudies": "Add new cases when CIAA/OAG files new Special Court referrals or when investigative journalism uncovers new validated data.",
    "sources": "Verify and update URLs quarterly; replace 'pending' verification statuses as documents are cleared.",
    "impactMetrics": "Recalculate annually in conjunction with NPC and World Bank national accounting cycles."
