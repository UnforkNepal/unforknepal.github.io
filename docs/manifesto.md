# Unfork Nepal: Anti-Corruption Manifesto

**Kathmandu, Nepal - Sept 2025**

## Executive Summary

Unfork Nepal demands and commits to fight for immediate anti-corruption reforms
backed by global precedents. Drawing from Singapore's CPIB, US False Claims Act,
and Estonia's e-governance model, we will fight for:

**Core Reforms:**

- Independent CIAA with full prosecutorial powers
- Civil service accountability and merit-based governance
- Whistleblower protections with financial incentives
- Permanent disqualification for corrupt politicians
- Two-term PM limit to prevent power concentration
- Complete digitization with real-time spending transparency
- Hybrid youth representation with real decision-making power
- Pre/post-election accountability frameworks

**Timeline:** 180-day implementation with Supreme Court oversight, ordinances
and constitutional amendments.

**Success Target:** Singapore-level transparency within 2 years, NPR 100-200
billion asset recovery (based on successful international anti-corruption
recoveries).

Unfork Nepal commits to sustained peaceful pressure until genuine governance is
established.

## Affirmation of Parliamentary System

We affirm the parliamentary system as the most accountable and
corruption-resistant model for Nepal's governance. We aren't interested in a
directly elected Prime Minister because:

- **It does not solve corruption** - Direct election fails to prevent bribery,
  nepotism, and embezzlement, as seen in countries that have tried this model
- **It creates pseudo-stability that masks dictatorship** - A directly elected
  PM with unchecked power becomes an elected dictator, undermining democratic
  checks
- **It makes Nepal vulnerable to foreign influence** - As a small nation, direct
  PM elections become targets for external interference and manipulation
- **It ignores systemic reforms** - Focuses on personality rather than
  institutional change, leaving corruption networks intact

**Agreement Required:** Government commits to maintaining parliamentary system
with no direct PM elections, following successful models like the UK and Canada.

## Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (CIAA)

**CIAA must be fully independent: free from political influence, with real power
to prosecute anyone.**

We commit to fight for a truly independent CIAA modeled after Singapore's
Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) - the world's most effective
anti-corruption agency. It transformed Singapore from Asia's most corrupt nation
(CPI score: 3.18 in 1988) to Asia's least corrupt (83/100 in 2023), achieving a
50+ point improvement in one generation through systematic institutional reforms
and zero-tolerance enforcement (Harvard Kennedy School Singapore Corruption Case
Study):

- **Complete independence from political interference** - Commissioners
  appointed by independent panels of judges, academics, and civil society
  leaders, not politicians
- **Full prosecutorial powers** - Authority to investigate and convict ALL
  officials including politicians, bureaucrats, and business elites
- **No immunity for anyone** - Government officials, ministers, and civil
  servants have zero protection from investigation
- **Immediate establishment with full operational capacity** - No waiting
  periods or phased implementation
- **Dedicated divisions** for political corruption, bureaucratic corruption, and
  corporate corruption
- **Constitutional firewall** - No commissioner may have held political office
  within 10 years prior to appointment
- **Public oversight board** - Youth and civil society monitors alongside CIAA
  operations

**Penalty Structure for Non-Compliance:**

- **Interference with CIAA investigations:** 10-15 year imprisonment for
  government officials
- **Failure to cooperate with CIAA:** Automatic dismissal and 5-year ban from
  public service
- **Obstruction of justice:** Confiscation of assets and lifetime political bans
- **False testimony to CIAA:** 3-7 year imprisonment and fines up to NPR 5
  million

**Agreement Required:** PM ordinance establishing independent CIAA within 15
days, with constitutional amendment commitment upon parliament reconvening.

## Civil Service Accountability and Reform

**End political interference. Merit-based governance with zero tolerance for
corruption.**

We demand transformation of Nepal's civil service into a professional,
accountable bureaucracy:

### Core Reforms

- **Merit-based appointments and promotions** - End political interference in
  hiring and advancement
- **Mandatory asset declarations and lifestyle audits** - Annual public
  verification of all civil servants' assets
- **Performance-based accountability** - Measurable KPIs with automatic
  penalties for delays (>30 days: 10% salary deduction)
- **Team complicity rule** - Entire departments held accountable for individual
  corruption failures
- **Anti-corruption training** - Mandatory programs for all civil servants with
  ethical standards code

### Transparency Measures

- **Procurement oversight** - All contracts >NPR 1 million publicly tendered and
  monitored
- **Travel monitoring** - Strict oversight of official foreign trips and
  expenditures
- **Citizen feedback systems** - Real-time public rating dashboards for service
  delivery
- **Internal reporting obligations** - Mandatory corruption reporting with
  severe penalties for non-compliance

**Agreement Required:** Civil Service Accountability Commission established
within 30 days, reforms implemented within 90 days.

## Whistleblower Protection and Incentives

**Whistleblowers are heroes, not traitors. Protect them, reward them, empower
them.**

Inspired by the US False Claims Act - which has recovered over $70 billion since
1986 through successful prosecutions and settlements, including $2.2 billion in
healthcare fraud alone in FY 2023 (US Department of Justice False Claims Act
Report) - we demand:

### Core Framework

- **Ironclad legal protection** from retaliation, harassment, job loss,
  transfers, or demotions
- **Financial rewards** (5-15% of recovered corrupt funds) with tax exemptions
- **Secure anonymous reporting** channels with 24/7 hotlines and online portals
- **Complete identity protection** throughout investigation and prosecution
- **Witness protection and psychological support** for high-risk cases

### Penalty Structure

- **Retaliation against whistleblowers:** 5-10 year imprisonment
- **Failure to protect whistleblowers:** Fines up to NPR 10 million
- **False accusations:** Civil penalties and defamation charges

**Agreement Required:** Protection Act enacted within 45 days, anonymous
channels operational within 30 days.

## Immediate Investigations into Politicians

We demand accountability for past corruption through:

- Comprehensive, independent investigations of all politicians with corruption
  allegations
- Lifetime bans from public office for those proven guilty of corruption
- Mandatory asset declarations and verification for all politicians
- No statute of limitations on corruption cases
- Immediate commencement of investigations

**Agreement Required:** Independent investigation commission established within
15 days, with investigations beginning immediately.

## Two-Term Limit for Prime Minister

We demand structural limits on executive power:

- Maximum two terms for any Prime Minister regardless of party or coalition
- Immediate implementation through PM ordinance with constitutional backing upon
  parliament reconvening
- Clear succession planning mechanisms
- Prevention of power concentration in executive office

**Agreement Required:** PM ordinance implementing two-term limit within 30 days,
with constitutional amendment commitment upon parliament reconvening.

## Complete Digitization and Public Disclosure (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**No more hidden budgets, no more secret spending. Every rupee tracked in
real-time.**

We demand absolute transparency in public funds, following Estonia's
e-governance model. This digitally advanced government has eliminated corruption
through complete digitization (World Bank Estonia Country Program Evaluation
2007-2017), made 99% of public services available online (Estonia e-Governance
Solutions), and improved from CPI score 57.9 in 2003 to 76 in 2023 (Transparency
International CPI) by reducing bureaucratic corruption by 30% through digital
transparency (OECD Estonia Digital Government Review 2023):

- **Real-time tracking and public display** of all government spending
- **No exceptions** - all allocations, contracts, and expenditures made
  immediately public
- **Complete digital audit trail** from allocation to utilization
- **Free, searchable public databases** accessible to all citizens
- **Initial operational dashboards within 30 days** - full coverage of all
  ministries within 60-90 days
- **Blockchain-verified transactions** to prevent tampering
- **Mobile apps and APIs** for citizen access to spending data

**Agreement Required:** Full digitization completed within 60 days with public
dashboards operational within 30 days. This is non-negotiable.

## Youth Reservation and Representation

**Youth voices must shape Nepal's future. Merit-based youth representation with
real power and accountability.**

We demand a hybrid youth representation model combining demographic
proportionality with merit-based selection. It follows successful models from
Finland, New Zealand, and Canada where youth parliaments have driven innovative
policymaking and reduced corruption through fresh perspectives:

### Selection and Representation Framework

  representation, 50% through competitive merit-based process
- **Age bracket expansion**: Youth defined as 18-40 to include more experienced
  young leaders
- **Guaranteed executive positions**: Youth ministers in key portfolios
  (Education, Youth & Sports, ICT, Environment)

  impacting youth (education, employment, digital rights)
- **Annual performance reviews**: Public evaluation of youth representatives'
  effectiveness
- **Recall elections**: Citizens can petition for removal of underperforming
  representatives
- **Succession planning**: Mentorship programs pairing youth representatives
  with experienced parliamentarians

### Capacity Building and Support

  elected representatives
- **Anti-discrimination measures**: Penalties for marginalizing or ignoring
  youth representatives
- **Resource allocation**: Dedicated budget for youth representative offices and
  operations
- **Judicial oversight**: Supreme Court monitoring of youth representation
  implementation

**Agreement Required:** Government commits to constitutional amendments through
available legal mechanisms, with youth representatives seated within 90 days of
parliament reconvening.

## Pre/Post-Election Safeguards
